# Show Box BG
A very simple show-box with images as a background of the div


You have to:

1) add images with "small" suffix in their filename (like "image-small.jpg") to html

2) add class="showbox" to these images

3) upload images with "big" suffix in their filename (like "image-big.jpg") to the same folder as small images

4) put css and js into your css and js or link them
